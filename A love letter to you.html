    <h1 id="title2">Dear Kyle</h1>
    <p class="memory">
        When I first met you, I didn't think we would be where we are. You have become my sun, my moon and everything in my orbit.
        I work for you, I go to school for you, I cook for you, my life revolves around you. 
    </p>
    <p class="memory">As the days turn into weeks and the weeks into months, I find myself daydreaming about the future we could build together. 
        I can't wait for the house, the kids, the wedding, the pets; we will build a future together. 
        A future filled with shared laughter, quiet moments of understanding, happiness and a life of everything we can imagine. 
    </p>
    <p class="memory">I remember the first time we met. You picked me up and we shared small talk in the car on the way to walmart. When we got out of
        the car, you where nervous I would be taller than you, turns out I was and still am. You bought another vitamin to add to your collection
        and then we went to the candy isle, you let me pick out whatever I wanted. When we left the store and got to the car, we had our first
        kiss.
    </p>
    <p class="memory"> After walmart, we went to dairy queen. I remember you got cherry chocolate icecream all over your pants. We went back to your house 
        and watched UFC in your bed. This was the night we sparked our love. I will never forget it. I can't wait to make more and more memories
        with you everyday. Happy Birthday Kyle, you are everything to me.
    </p>
